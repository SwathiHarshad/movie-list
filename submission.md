## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

- Optimize the code by reducing the variable and make the code reusable.
- Router to differentiate the pages.
- Transition UI with little bit of animation.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

- Nope, I didn't deviate from the direction.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

- The app wasn't working in the Node.js V10. So I had to upgrade my lap's version.
- I do have day job, so I couldn't do optimized work in the given period. Sorry for the inconvenience.
